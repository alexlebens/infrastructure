# Source: rook-ceph/charts/rook-ceph/templates/clusterrole.yaml
# Used for provisioning ObjectBuckets (OBs) in response to ObjectBucketClaims (OBCs).
# Note: Rook runs a copy of the lib-bucket-provisioner's OBC controller.
# OBCs can be created in any Kubernetes namespace, so this must be a cluster-scoped role.
